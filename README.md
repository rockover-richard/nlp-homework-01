# README for Homework 1

# Structure of Homework
The entirety of my code is divided into (3) .py files:
* preprocessing.py - this holds most of the code to preprocess training and test data
* training.py - this holds most of the code for training the models, including probability calculations and building probability dictionaries
* testing.py - this holds most of the code for testing the models with test data

# What to Run
To best see the code that answers the questions, I created <b>answers.py</b> and the jupyter notebook <b>Homework_1.ipynb</b>.<br>
## answers.py
answers.py is a step-by-step .py file that begins by importing the (3) files above and works through each question and also provides the code required from the different files to answer the question. The function calls will point to which .py file to look at to see the underlying code (e.g. preprocessing.preprocess_test(sample)).<br><br>
When you run answers.py in a command line, it will just require presses of the ENTER button to continue through the questions. This was done for easier viewing.<br>
## Homework_1.ipynb
Homework_1.ipnyb is the jupyter notebook that serves as the base for my write-up.<br><br>
Homework_1.ipnyb is a more reader-friendly version of answers.py, and also contains the written explanations and math equations that were not practical to put into answers.py.

# Thank you!
